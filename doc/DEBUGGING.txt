The following enables testing the extension while in development (so
that changes to the source code take effect upon restarting the browser,
without having to recompile and reinstall the add-on). Assume $ROOT to
be the root of this repository.

1. Install the add-on in Firefox in the normal way from a .xpi file, and
  close Firefox.
2. Find the installed add-on in the Mozilla files, typically in the
  following path, where [profile] indicates your user's profile id.
  ~/.mozilla/firefox/[profile]/extensions/jam-extension@policy-weaving.cs.wisc.edu.xpi
3. Delete the installed .xpi file identified in the previous step.
4. In the file $ROOT/doc/jam-extension@policy-weaving.cs.wisc.edu, enter
  the absolute path of the $ROOT/src/ directory. (The path should be the
  only text in the file.)
5. Copy this file to the Mozilla extensions directory (the contained the
  installed compiled extension that was deleted in step 3).
6. When you open Firefox next, it will execute the extension directly
  from the source code.
